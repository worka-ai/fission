Fission is a GPU-accelerated, widget-based UI framework for Rust. It draws
inspiration from Flutter's build/layout/paint architecture while embracing
Rust's type system to deliver deterministic state management, serializable
action traces, and headless testability out of the box. Rendering is powered by
[Vello](https://github.com/linebender/vello) and
[wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), giving you high-performance 2D (and
optional 3D) graphics on every platform that wgpu supports.

## Key Features

- **GPU-accelerated rendering** -- Vello + wgpu backend with a trait-based
  renderer interface (Skia backend is also scaffolded).
- **Widget-based architecture** -- Flutter-inspired `build` / `layout` / `paint`
  pipeline. Widgets are plain Rust structs; no closures in the tree.
- **Deterministic state management** -- Actions are serializable descriptors,
  reducers are pure functions, and effects are explicit. Every state transition
  is replayable.
- **Rich widget library** -- 50+ ready-made widgets including buttons, text
  inputs, modals, popovers, menus, tabs, drawers, calendars, date pickers,
  data tables, charts, tree views, drag-and-drop, and more.
- **Theming and i18n** -- First-class theme tokens and internationalization
  support baked into the core.
- **Accessibility** -- Semantic roles, labels, and focus traversal are mandatory
  for interactive elements, with mappings to platform accessibility APIs.
- **Charts** -- A dedicated charting crate for data visualization widgets.
- **3D integration** -- Embed wgpu-based 3D scenes as first-class widgets.
- **Text engine** -- Rope-backed text engine (`ropey`) for efficient large-document editing.
- **Desktop shell** -- Native macOS, Linux, and Windows support via `winit`.
- **Mobile shell** -- Planned.
- **Web shell** -- Planned.
- **Diagnostics** -- Structured, zero-cost-when-disabled diagnostic events for
  profiling and debugging.
- **Testing infrastructure** -- Headless test harness with selectors, geometry
  assertions, action assertions, structural snapshots, and golden-image pixel
  tests. A remote test driver enables CI-friendly E2E testing.

## Architecture Overview

```
Widget::build()
    |
    v
Authoring Node tree  (open-world: any Widget can participate)
    |
    v
Lower to Core IR     (closed-world: fixed set of structural, layout,
    |                  paint, input, scroll, and embed ops)
    v
Layout pass          (constraint propagation, flex, scroll, baselines)
    |
    v
Paint / Display list (deterministic paint order, PaintMap)
    |
    v
Renderer             (Vello/wgpu rasterization)
```

The framework enforces a strict separation between the **authoring layer**
(widgets, macros, high-level API) and the **core layer** (IR, layout, semantics,
rendering). The authoring layer is intentionally open -- anyone can add new
widgets without modifying the core. The core IR is closed and versioned,
guaranteeing that layout and paint are deterministic across releases.

## Quick Start

Add Fission to your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
fission = "0.1"
fission-core = "0.1"
fission-widgets = "0.1"
fission-macros = "0.1"
fission-shell-desktop = "0.1"
```

A minimal counter application:

```rust
use fission_core::action::ActionId;
use fission_core::ui::{Button, Column, Node, Text, TextContent};
use fission_core::{AppState, BuildCtx, Handler, ReducerContext, View, Widget};
use fission_macros::Action;
use fission_shell_desktop::DesktopApp;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

// 1. Define your application state.
#[derive(Default, Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct CounterState {
    value: i32,
}
impl AppState for CounterState {}

// 2. Define actions as serializable structs.
#[derive(Action, Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
struct Increment;

// 3. Write a pure reducer.
fn on_increment(
    state: &mut CounterState,
    _action: Increment,
    _ctx: &mut ReducerContext<CounterState>,
) {
    state.value += 1;
}

// 4. Build your widget tree.
struct CounterApp;

impl Widget<CounterState> for CounterApp {
    fn build(&self, ctx: &mut BuildCtx<CounterState>, view: &View<CounterState>) -> Node {
        Column {
            children: vec![
                Text {
                    content: TextContent::Literal(format!("Count: {}", view.state.value)),
                    font_size: Some(24.0),
                    ..Default::default()
                }
                .into(),
                Button {
                    on_press: Some(ctx.bind(
                        Increment,
                        on_increment as Handler<CounterState, Increment>,
                    )),
                    child: Some(Box::new(
                        Text {
                            content: TextContent::Literal("Increment".into()),
                            ..Default::default()
                        }
                        .into(),
                    )),
                    ..Default::default()
                }
                .into(),
            ],
            ..Default::default()
        }
        .into()
    }
}

// 5. Launch.
fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    DesktopApp::new(CounterApp).run()
}
```

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** nightly toolchain (the project uses edition 2021; a recent nightly is
  recommended for full feature support).
- **System dependencies** for wgpu/Vello:
  - **macOS**: Xcode command-line tools.
  - **Linux**: `libwayland-dev`, `libxkbcommon-dev`, `libvulkan-dev` (or
    equivalent for your distro).
  - **Windows**: A Vulkan-capable GPU driver; the Windows SDK is also
    recommended.

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/worka-ai/fission.git
cd fission
cargo build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```
