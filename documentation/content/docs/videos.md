# Fission video calendar

This calendar is the public plan for Fission video content. The goal is simple: ship at least one useful video every week, and make each video leave behind a real Fission example that viewers can run, inspect, and adapt.

The videos are free on YouTube. The value for Fission comes from consistent proof: every week should make another part of the framework easier to trust. A viewer should be able to watch the video, open the matching example, and understand how to build that piece of an app themselves.

## Format for each episode

Every episode should produce more than a video. The weekly package should include:

| Asset | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Video | A clear walkthrough with the finished app visible early, then the implementation explained step by step. |
| Example app | A production-style Fission example in the repository, structured with clear modules, components, state, and tests. |
| Documentation link | A short guide or reference update when the video covers a widget, capability, shell, CLI feature, or workflow. |
| Screenshot | One or more real screenshots from the Fission app for the website, README, and video thumbnail planning. |
| Tests | Unit, smoke, or integration tests that prove the app or feature keeps working. |

The examples should not be toy code unless the video is explicitly about a tiny concept. When the video is about a widget, show the widget in a realistic screen. When the video is about a capability, show the complete host setup needed to use it. When the video is about an app, structure the code the way we want Fission developers to structure production apps.

## Content pillars

The two-year plan rotates through these pillars so the channel does not become repetitive:

| Pillar | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| Core Fission | The state model, widget tree, reducers, resources, services, testing, and rendering pipeline are understandable. |
| Widgets | Fission has a broad, polished widget catalog and each widget can be used in real layouts. |
| Apps | Fission can build complete products, not only isolated controls. |
| Charts | Fission can handle serious dashboards and data-heavy UI. |
| Platform capabilities | Desktop, web, Android, and iOS apps can access host capabilities through a consistent Rust API. |
| Shells | Desktop, mobile, web, terminal, and static site targets are first-class outcomes. |
| Production lifecycle | The CLI supports setup, running, testing, packaging, release, and publishing workflows. |

## Two-year schedule

The dates assume a weekly cadence starting in June 2026. If a week slips, keep the order unless a release, bug fix, or new framework feature makes a later topic more useful to ship first.

## Maintenance notes

As videos are produced, update the matching row with the final title, YouTube link, repository path, and status. If a topic exposes a missing feature or poor API, keep the episode honest: explain the limitation, open the follow-up issue, and use the next suitable episode to show the improvement.

A good weekly rhythm is:

1. Pick the example and define the viewer outcome.
2. Build or improve the example app.
3. Add tests and screenshots.
4. Update documentation.
5. Record the video.
6. Publish the video and update this calendar.

The calendar should remain flexible, but the standard should not. Every shipped video should make Fission more understandable, more trustworthy, and easier to adopt.

## Lifecycle fit and verification

This page belongs to the setup, learn, build, test, and publish lifecycle. Use it to decide the next concrete action, then verify the action before moving to the next stage.

| Stage question | Verification |
| --- | --- |
| What file or command changes? | The page should point to the exact `fission` command, `fission.toml` section, Rust component, or generated artifact involved. |
| What proves it worked? | Prefer a command output, generated file, screenshot, test assertion, package artifact, or deployed URL over a vague statement. |
| What can fail safely? | Permission prompts, missing tools, unsupported hosts, invalid config, and expired credentials should produce diagnosable errors that can be retried after the cause is fixed. |
| What should I read next? | Continue to the linked guide for step-by-step work or the reference page for exact fields and contracts. |
